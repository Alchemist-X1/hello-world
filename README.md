## learn about github
Github like a collector can gather all the modification submits by different persons to one item.


### 1 where is git hub
For new learner there is a software [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) could extend your GitHub workflow beyond your browser.
Just download and install it, and register an account follow the guide, then you could start to learn how to work with it.

### 2 Create a repository and write a README
When you first sign in the github desktop after created a new account, the software would ask to load a repository or create a new one. And I chose to create an new repository in a empty hard disk.

*Fine!*

**I fialed to write a new README for my new repository branch created by github desktop.**

***But it's ok***
***Because I find another way to edit on website.***
